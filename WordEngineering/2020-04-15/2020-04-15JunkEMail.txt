This repository would be maintained in multiple locations, data centers.
All these repositories would be replicated in real time.

These data elements would be exposed to consumers such as .com, Mobile Web, Mobile apps etc through services.
Need Cassandra expertise (2 years), good knowledge on version 2.0.
Experience in creating data models for real time applications with
 huge data volume
 very high TPS and
 low latency.
Also J2EE, Spring MVC framework experience.

Dear Friend,
 
          I am Olivia Amoah Kamara the wife of late Colonel Vincent
Kamara who was a Sierra Leone Military Officer.My husband died in a
rebel conflict back in 2001 which was the turning point of my life as
I was shattered and up till today,I still live with the grief of his
death as I have suffered the loss of his death till this very day. My
late husband left me with several inheritance which ranged from
Properties to Money and all this have been seized by my husbands
family members who chased me away from his family compound together
with my 9months old daughter who later died two weeks later due to the
harsh conditions we faced during the run away from my late husbands
hostile family members.Before the death of my husband,he was involved
in diamond businesses and had saved in 3 different countries which
were Sierra Leone, Ghana and Angola and the information about this
savings is known by me and his family members excluding one which he
kept a secret between me and him and that is the funds in Ghana.The
rest was seized by his family members excluding this one in Ghana
which they do not know about so I managed to hide away the deposit
certificate from them.Since the death of my late husband,I have
refused to get married and had no other child with him excluding my
9months old daughter who died in the harsh hands of fate.I met my
husband during his trade times in Ghana as we fell in love and got
married after he divorced his first wife who was a Sierra Leonean.
 
          I am writing you this letter because I was diagnosed with
esophageal cancer back in 2008 which has defiled all forms of medical
treatments and as well ate almost all my savings here in Ghana which
my husband left for me before his death.I have used my savings for my
living and treatment but the problem I face now is that I have only
about a few months to live which have been defined by my doctor as
indefinite.I must confess to you that I have lived in so much grief
all my life since I came back to Ghana in 2003 and have never been a
giver as I was totally lost in my own world all years.Now that my life
is conditional,I have decided to do the will of God by giving alms to
charity organizations but I cannot do this myself anymore because of
my health.I have now a huge funds deposit of US$10 Million United
States Dollars with a bank here in Ghana in the name of my late
husband so I  do want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch
it to charity organizations.You will keep out 20% of the funds for
your assistance in doing this great work all the stress that will go
with it.Write me back in my email so that we can proceed further.
 
Your Sincerely,
Mrs. Olivia Amoah Kamara.

Climate Change: How Tech Can Help
Clicking Clean: How Companies are Creating the Green Internet
Report: How Europe & The US Differ On Attitudes To Green IT
 
Technology is usually the first to be blamed for climate change, but could the industry turn its reputation from red to Green? This week we look at whether technology could actually provide a solution to global warming, with a new report from Greenpeace on the greenest global tech companies, and an investigation into differing views on Green IT. What do you think? Is technology the cause or the solution to climate change? Take our poll and let us know.

How Can Tech Help Mitigate Climate Change?
Technology has a bad reputation when it comes to the environment, and now, two major climate change reports warn that technology is helping change the world for the worst. But can it help too? IT expert, Nick Booth, reviews the Greenpeace and IPCC reports, and asks whether tech is just the cause of climate change, or whether it can be the solution as well.  Read the analysis now.
 
 
Which Is the Greenest Tech Company?
From social media to music, streaming video, email and commerce, we are increasingly moving much of our lives online. But which companies are storing all of that data, and how are they getting the energy? Here's who hosts some of the internet's most popular sites and services in their data centers - and whether those companies are using dirty or clean energy. Find out how you can #clickclean, download the full report and take action for a green internet.
 
 
Who's Heard Of Green IT?
A recent report, 'The Cloud Begins With Coal', calculated that the ICT ecosystem now approaches 10% of world electricity generation. The amount of literature on the Datacenter's carbon impact increases daily. The issue of being Green has never been higher on the agenda, but how do professionals feel about Green IT, and how does this vary either side of the Atlantic? Download the paper now and find out.

Special Message Of The Month!


Finding Your Magic Investing Formula
By Robert Kiyosaki

People often ask me, "How do you find great investments?" My standard reply is, "You have to train your brain to see them. Great investments are all around you."

I know that's not a very satisfying answer. Most people want something more specific and concrete. But my reply is as accurate as possible. If we could've seen all the great investments just in the past decade, we'd all be multibillionaires.

Missing Out on Millions

There have never been more opportunities to become rich than in the last 10 years. And there'll be even more opportunities in the next 10.

Let me explain. Like many investors, I didn't see the power of eBay almost a decade ago. If I had, I'd be a billionaire today. Nor did I see the power of YouTube, or Google, or MySpace. Being an old guy, my brain isn't trained to see investing opportunities in cyberspace. So I missed them.

Thirty years ago, when my business career was just starting at Xerox, I was introduced to a new type of computer. I wasn't tuned into computers at the time, so little did I know that I was looking at the early version of what was to become the Macintosh. So I also missed that billion-dollar opportunity, too. How many billion-dollar opportunities have I missed? Maybe millions.

If I've missed so many million- and billion-dollar opportunities, why am I writing for Yahoo! Finance? That's a valid question, and the answer has to do with helping you find great investments.

Perseverance Pays Off

I took my first real estate investment course in 1974 in Honolulu. The cost was $385, and I believe it was two or three days long. Toward the end of the class, the instructor said something I've never forgotten: "Now you know the difference between good real estate investments and bad real estate investments. Now you all know what to look for."

He paused and then added, "The problem is, most people will tell you such investments don't exist. Your friends will tell you so, and so will real estate agents." Truer words were never spoken. For the next few months, I went from real estate office to real estate office, looking for investments. As promised, the real estate agents told me what I was looking for didn't exist. My friends and co-workers at Xerox told me the same thing, and said I was either dreaming or smoking funny cigarettes.

Finally, in a small, obscure real estate office in downtown Waikiki, I met a scruffy little broker who said, "I have what you want." The next weekend I was on a plane to Maui, where he'd found an entire condominium development that was in foreclosure.

I purchased my first piece of investment real estate for $18,000, putting the $2,000 down payment on my credit card. The one-bedroom/one-bath condo paid me a positive cash flow, even after all the expenses and mortgage payments. My investment career had begun. More important, I was training my brain to see what most people don't see. That $385 real estate course has made me millions of dollars over the years.

Keep an Open mind

Last month, around tax time, I wrote a Yahoo! Finance column called "Think Rich to Lower Your Taxes." It was about an investment strategy known as the "velocity of money," and how I use it to invest, make a lot of money, and then legally use the tax laws to minimize my own taxes. I suspected the column would spark some controversy, and it did.

For a couple of weeks, I kept track of the reader responses to it. Some of the less-complimentary comments reminded me of what those real estate agents and my friends at Xerox said to me back in 1974.

You see, our brains are either our greatest assets or our greatest liabilities. As I said, when it comes to investment opportunities in technology, my brain is a liability; I just don't get it. When it comes to investment opportunities in real estate, gold, oil, and silver I'm above average, but not great. And that's because I've trained my brain to see opportunities in those areas.

So, instead of criticizing the readers who were close-minded (or even mean-spirited) about my advice, I encourage them to keep an open mind and find their own way of seeing investments most people miss. That's how you get rich. People who refuse to open their minds to new strategies seldom become rich -- which I guess is why there are more critics in the world than rich people.

Finding Your Magic Formula

One of the most important things my rich dad taught me was to never say, "I can't do it" or "I can't afford it." Those thoughts are self-limiting, and it's hard to find great investments when you're basing your behavior on limitations. In today's world, there are more investing opportunities than ever before. Why would anyone want limited financial results in an unlimited world?

One of the reasons I write for Yahoo! Finance is so I can put forth ideas that challenge the way people think about investing. If you want the same old financial-planning dogma of "work hard, save money, live below your means, get out of debt, and invest in a well-diversified portfolio of mutual funds," then my column is obviously not for you.

My job is to stimulate your thinking, inform you about why rich people get richer, and encourage you to find the magic financial formula that works for you. I found mine, and I want you to find yours.

Mortgage Rates Fall Again
by Les Christie@CNNMoney

This data was released on March 6th. After three weeks of trending higher, mortgage rates have once again turned lower.

The 30-year fixed rate came in at an average of 4.28%, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey. That's down from 4.37% last week.

Meanwhile, 15-year fixed rates, popular with homeowners refinancing their loans, were at 3.32%, down from 3.39% last week.

Rates have been affordable all year -- from a low of 4.23% to a high of 4.53% -- as the economic recovery has failed to pick up much steam.

"Mortgage rates were down this week as real GDP was revised downwards to 2.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013" said Frank Nothaft, Freddie's chief economist.

The brutal winter weather is also having an impact, according to Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage information from HSH.com

"For the moment, mortgage rates are holding nearer to 2014 lows than highs" he said. "As the effects of winter weather begins to wear off, and if a peaceful solution can be found to quell the unrest in the Ukraine, mortgage rates can be expected to firm up again."

Cheap mortgages are a bonanza for buyers. At 4.28% mortgage payments on a $200,000 loan come to just $987 a month. At a historically more normal (but still reasonable) rate of 6%, the payment would be about $1200.

10 Cities People Are Moving To
as reported from CNN Real Estate

Whether it's the warm weather, jobs or cheap cost of living, these are the top 10 cities Americans are moving to, according to Penske Truck Rental's annual list.

1 - Atlanta, GA
Median income: $66,300
Median home price: $166,000
Home price growth forecast : 5.3%

Even though it was hit hard by the recession, Atlanta has claimed the top spot on Penske's list for four years running. Home to Coca-Cola, Home Depot and roughly a dozen other Fortune 500 companies, the city offers a range of job opportunities. And the cost of living is pretty cheap -- less than half the cost of Manhattan -- with much warmer weather (well... except for this winter).

2 - Tampa, FL
Median income: $56,800
Median home price: $129,000
Home price growth forecast : 6.5%

Beaches, boating and baseball are among some of the top reasons people come to Tampa, which is a newcomer to the top cities list. Several Major League Baseball teams come here for Spring training and MacDill Air Force Base has long been one of the biggest employers in the area.

3 - Dallas, TX
Median income: $69,000
Median home price: $208,000
Home price growth forecast : 4%

Fast-growing Dallas is now the ninth biggest city in the country. So many tech companies have opened facilities here, including Texas Instruments, AT&T and several startups, that the city is now being referred to as the "Silicon Prairie."

4 - Orlando, FL
Median income: $58,500
Median home price: $153,000
Home price growth forecast : 2.9%

When the economy is strong and people start splurging on vacations again, Orlando flourishes. Home to Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World, tourism jobs attract many newcomers to the area. And its reasonable cost of living -- about 10% less than Miami's -- and warm winters attract retirees and outdoor lovers of all ages.

5 - Phoenix, AZ
Median income: $62,200
Median home price: $187,000
Home price growth forecast : 4.3%

Phoenix was one of the hardest hit cities in the nation when the housing bubble burst. But now it's turning around and sun-seeking home buyers are scooping up homes at bargain basement prices. Among the top employers in the area are Wal-Mart, Intel and several major banks, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.

6 - Houston, TX
Median income: $66,200
Median home price: $190,000
Home price growth forecast : 3.9%

The oil and gas industry has kept Houston's economy humming, with unemployment at a comparatively low 5.6% in November. It's about to get another boost with the opening of a massive new ExxonMobil facility next year that's expected to employ 10,000 workers.

7 - Seattle, WA
Median income: $86,700
Median home price: $343,000
Home price growth forecast : 5.2%

It may have plenty of gray, rainy days, but Seattle also has some great coffee, a thriving music and arts scene and, most importantly, jobs. Home to Microsoft, Amazon.com and Boeing, among many other companies, Seattle has become an economic powerhouse, attracting tech workers, outdoors types and those seeking world-class access to arts and entertainment.

8 - Chicago, IL
Median income: $73,400
Median home price: $210,000
Home price growth forecast : 2.7%

With its parks, museums and active nightlife, the "Windy City" offers some of New York's vitality and charms but at a much lower cost. People moving to Chicago from Manhattan will spend about 25% less on groceries and a whopping 70% less on housing. Hiring is still slow, however, with unemployment at 8.1 % in November.

9 - Denver, CO
Median income: $77,800
Median home price: $263,000
Home price growth forecast : 2.7%

Outdoorsy Denver consistently ranks as one of the healthiest and most active places in the nation. With the Rocky Mountains at its doorstep, skiers, hikers and mountain bikers all flock to the "Mile High City." The economy is strong with unemployment falling to 5.8% in November, well under the national rate.

10 - Las Vegas, NV
Median income: $63,100
Median home price: $175,000
Home price growth forecast : 5.4%

Gaming, tourism and conventions dominate Vegas' economy -- and, for better or for worse, so does real estate. Home to many hospitality workers, entertainers and retirees, the city was the poster child of the foreclosure crisis and is just now making a comeback.

The Big Money Lie

Want to hear a funny joke?

A poor family is arguing about money. Fed up, the wife shouts, "If we had more money, there wouldn't be any money problems!"

At the same time a middle-class family is also arguing about finances. Disgusted, the husband yells, "If we had more money, there wouldn't be any money problems!"

And at the very same time a rich family argues about the family fortune. Finally everyone shouts, "If we had more money, there wouldn't be any money problems!"

Funny joke, right?

Not really.

Sadly, just like me, you've probably found yourself in the same situation - arguing or fighting about finances and thinking "more money" is the answer to your money problems.

WRONG!

This might sting a bit, but if you find yourself having money problems with a small amount of money, a large amount of money with just create bigger money problems!

You've probably heard all the expo's on the news about former lottery ticket winners. They almost always all go from flat broke to filthy rich and back to flat broke in the drop of a hat. Lots of money doesn't solve money problems.

Or in a more common case, how often do you hear about someone coming into a sum of unexpected money or getting a raise at work only to get themselves right back in the same financial trouble. Maybe this has even happened to you???

In our super-consumer culture, most folks live their whole lives in denial. They struggle and stress about money and keep fooling themselves into thinking their money problems will all magically go away if they just get a little more of it.

Reality is, if you don't have a firm understanding of how much you earn, how much you spend, what your weekly and monthly cash flow is and most importantly the discipline to control your spending, your money problems will never go away.

There's a saying that goes like this, "Wisdom is cheap and experience is expensive." In other words, it's a lot easier and will cost you a lot less to learn from others than to go through the pain yourself.

Look around and realize for yourself "more money" isn't the answer to your money problems. It really is just a big, stinking lie (and one that causes a lot of folks an enormous amount of hardships).

So the next time you find yourself dealing with money troubles, whether big or small, don't fall into the trap of just saying, "More money will make the problem go away." Really sit back and take a good look at how much you're earning and spending and if there's a better and wiser way you can use the money you actually have.







Home Value Boosting Tip of the Month

Refinishing Doors

So, let's say you're sprucing up the homestead, but you got these bland old, cheap press-wood doors everywhere!

Thinking about refinishing them?

Think again! Unless you have antique or Victorian doors, which can't be replaced, refinishing doors is a huge pain in the butt! The cost of materials and labor alone make it a poor investment. You can often buy a new door for the same price! Plus, refinished doors tend to still look cheap.

Why not replace those old doors??

Replacing interior doors is a great way to add value to your home and doesn't require advanced craftsman skills. But don't replace the old shabby doors with new bland ones. Did you know the difference in price from a plain boring door to a terrific looking 6 panel door is usually only $15? So if you have 10 doors in your home - just an extra $150 takes you from new boring replacement doors to doors that will really stand out! Many even come pre-painted!

Tip - Be sure to measure the size of your door frame. While most doors are standard - some aren't - especially in older houses. Do the same when changing out your doorknobs.

I am Mrs. Ruth Smith, A widow to Late Mr. John Smith, I am 73years old, and I am now a new Christian convert, suffering from long time cancer of the ear. From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't live long according to my doctors.

 

This is because my cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. My late husband was killed during the U.S raid, against terrorism in Afghanistan when he traveled to Afghanistan to monitor a Hospital/a Humanitarian Found at (HHF) he was setting up for the benefit of the Afghan masses as of then; whose majority and 99 percent of them are Muslims/ Islamic scholars and loyalists. During the period of our marriage we couldn't produce any child.. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his businesses and wealth, and when I noticed that my condition is not improving rather it gets worsen by the day I decided to divide part of this wealth, to contribute to Charity and the development of the churches in Africa, America , Asia and Europe . I selected you after visiting the internet and I prayed over it. I am willing to donate the fund to you for charity, the less privileged, churches, orphanages and widows, Propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

 

I took this decision upon myself because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. Because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Christ is vanity upon vanity.

 

Please I want you to note that this fund was deposited in a BANK for security purpose. And upon my instruction,my late husbands lawyer will file application to the BANK for the release of the consignment to you. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you and your family.Await Your Urgent Reply (mrs.ruth_smith2014@yahoo.com  ),any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church, another person or Christian individual for this same purpose.

 

Yours in Christ

Ruth Smith

Chart FX 8 now makes it a whole lot easier to integrate charts to your MVC applications!

Since there is no design view or forms in MVC, you can't just drag and drop the chart where you want it displayed, making it difficult and cumbersome to integrate charts in your MVC projects. The optional Chart FX 8 MVC library contains a few methods that when called at the right place will include all the styles, scripts and routes necessary. All automatically and with minimal input from the developer. And there is no compromise, all Chart FX 8 features and extensions are available just as they are outside of the MVC environment.
	
	

	

	

	
	
Financial and Statistical Extensions now included!

With an impressive array of price and technical indicators, and even interactive drawing features Chart FX 8 introduces a well-organized sidebar from where to access indicators such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages and Volume. In addition,  Kagi, Point and Figure, Renko, and Three Line Break charts are provided as additional chart galleries. You can even customize and add your own technical indicators using Chart FX 8 powerful and intuitive API.
	
	
That's Right!

Wait, it's safe!
Dear Friend,
 
I am Josanne Coulibaly from Ivory Coast. I am 19 year of age. I am an orphan due to my father's sudden death in 2010. He died in Paris, France on a business trip. My father deposited the sum of USD$13,500, 000 as consignment with a security company overseas. It was disclosed to me by my father's lawyer after my father's death. As a young girl, my uncle forcefully took over my father's estates and his residential building immediately he died. There are rumors and speculations that he knew what happened to my father because he traveled together with my father to Paris.
 
I want you to assist me as my foreign trustee and guardian to retrieve the consignment from the security company and secure it in your country. I will join you in your country as soon as you receive the money.  I need your assistance to claim the consignment from the security company and invest it in your country. I don't want my wicked uncle to know about this money for the sake of my security. I need your help, honesty and love to secure this money.
 
You will take 25% of the money for your assistance and 5% for any expenses made while claiming the consignment from the security company. I will provide you with more details of the consignment and contact information's of the security company when I read from you.
 
Your suggestion will be regarded.
 
God Bless you,
Josanne Coulibaly		69
