Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none (Exodus 16:26). See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore He gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day (Exodus 16:29).

David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even (1 Samuel 20:5). Jonathan said unto David, When I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto you, and show it there (1 Samuel 20:12). When you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel (1 Samuel 20:19). David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel (1 Samuel 21:5). It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance (2 Samuel 1:2). So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to Him that sent me (2 Samuel 24:13). Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before your foes, while that the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts. Now therefore advise yourself what word I shall bring again to Him that sent me (1 Chronicles 21:12). After two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight (Hosea 6:2). Then Jesus called His disciples unto Him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, less they faint in the way (Matthew 15:32).
