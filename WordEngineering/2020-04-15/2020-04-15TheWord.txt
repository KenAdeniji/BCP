LORD is so kind to me, as to remember me in troubled times. You continue the ministry the same way you started, by fingering Me. As you go out, I will follow you. God, the same Spirit You've given me, please share with her. Always keep the people in memory. The food may not last forever, but I will last forever. As you share your moments, I will be with you. My grandfather said, staff school. I am a better person today, because of today. What you see in me is not really me, it is God that works in me. The design of the LORD. LORD's Word. When people ask about the Holy Spirit, say, the Holy Spirit is present where I AM present. The Son of God proves Himself by His mandate. Lays its man as it lays its eggs. You have to find a way to absorb. How to sacrifice to God without asking for favors. Remembering His promise, you will live. Give Me what you want. The Teacher will teach. In the midst of all the difficulties, I still remember you. That's you serve.	Veteran's day.
